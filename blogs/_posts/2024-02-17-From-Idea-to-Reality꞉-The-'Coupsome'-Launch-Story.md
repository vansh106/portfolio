It was my second semester during the COVID lockdown. Stuck in a room filled with boredom, I realized it was a pivotal moment to invest in myself for the future. I immersed myself in articles, blogs, and videos about coding and entrepreneurship. After a year dedicated to learning Android development, I was eager to embark on my first entrepreneurial venture. But first, I desperately needed an idea. I'd subconsciously trained my mind to seek business inspiration from events and experiences around me.


And it happened! I had this groundbreaking idea – one that seemed completely untapped. It was the day I received an exclusive Zomato coupon of worth 120 Rs but I gave it to a friend in need. That was my eureka moment. Why not create a marketplace where people could trade exclusive coupons at their own prices?


I was 19 and lacked industry experience. To validate my idea, I dived into hackathons. I built a team online, prototyped, and won. I felt accomplished, but didn't realize how much further I could go. Then, I stumbled onto a pitching competition by NIDHI PRAYAS – they offered grants for promising ideas. I registered, almost forgot about it, then scrambled to create the pitch deck the day before. During the presentation, everything clicked. People loved it, and I confidently answered all the questions. Some of the best moments happen when you least expect them! Days later, I received the email: *"Congrats! You've won 1st prize and a grant of 2 Lakhs INR"*. I can't even describe how it felt. That jolt of motivation fueled the birth of **Coupsome**. But the road ahead wasn't a walk in the park…

I decided to press pause on the idea for a while, focusing on college life. Fast forward to 2023 – I'm 21 now, partying  with my cousins, and I tell them about my concept. They go wild for it and immediately become my co-founders. We spent months hustling – they tackled the branding, I was all in on the code. But life happens, and their schedules got crazy. That's when I decided it was time to stop procrastinating. I got Coupsome incubated at VITTBI (my college's startup incubator), brought on seven interns, and in two intense months, we built the product and were excited to launch it.

Life with a startup is never smooth sailing, is it? Our payment provider, Razorpay, hit an RBI audit snag, blocking our onboarding.  They promised a month, but delays kept mounting. After six months, I switched to PhonePe, only to experience another month of KYC delays due to my packed schedule. Despite the roadblocks, I felt relief knowing things were finally sorted, and launch was close! I dove into marketing, unaware of the next curveball - PhonePe's service crashing. It seemed their Android SDK wasn't up to the task. Juggling everything became tough. By January 2024, Razorpay's audit ended, and they onboarded me. Sadly, as a final-year student, my priorities had shifted away from Coupsome.  But hope's not lost! I plan to reignite my passion and launch the MVP very soon. I may not know the exact date, but Coupsome's MVP release IS happening. Because when ideas are worth fighting for, you get back up.

*In a world of instant gratification, is the value of persistence often overlooked?*
